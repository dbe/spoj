This project is to track my progress with SPOJ (Sphere online judge: www.spoj.pl) which is a popular online programming problem site. I will be working almost solely in ruby, and will branch out as I get bored. I will try to have a readme, and a solution.rb file under each directory. The readme will have my notes and musings on the problem, while the solution.rb will have my most up to date solution. I will add a SOLVED file which will give the details of the submission (runtime, memory etc) once I have solved a problem.

Note: The README files in each of the projects will be equivalent to me thinking out loud! Do not judge these as prepared blog posts, many times they will be just a way for me to get ideas coming out of my head onto paper without any real tremendous pre-though. You have been warned :)
